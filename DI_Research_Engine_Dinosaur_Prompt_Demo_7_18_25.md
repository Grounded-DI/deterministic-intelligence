# 🧠 DI Research Engine – Logic Audit Sample: Dinosaur Case

Welcome to a **public-facing snapshot** of how the **DI Research Engine** reconstructs research using deterministic intelligence. This system doesn't summarize — it **classifies, scores, and audits** each claim based on logic strength and entropy risk.

---

## 📘 About the DI Research Engine

The **DI Research Engine** is built on deterministic logic architecture, governed by the **AGDI Protocol**. It does not guess. It evaluates.

Core features:
- Tiered logic reconstruction (Tier 1–3)
- Entropy scoring and override detection
- Citation laundering flags
- CleanPub metadata scan stubs
- MirrorMind passive authorship trace

No probabilistic summarization. No token weighting. Only auditable, structured reasoning.

## 🧾 Prompt Used

```text
Reconstruct the logic used to determine dinosaur behavior and extinction causes from fossil evidence.

Classify each conclusion into one of three tiers:

• Tier 1: Direct evidence with no speculative gap (e.g., physical fossil structure, geological dating confirmed by multiple methods).  
• Tier 2: Inferences supported by strong but indirect evidence (e.g., probable movement patterns based on bone placement, tool-mark correlations).  
• Tier 3: Speculative or cultural interpretations (e.g., theories about social behavior, extinction causes based on incomplete global records).

Final output should separate Tier 1 facts from Tier 2 inferences and Tier 3 hypotheses. Highlight any logic drift, citation laundering, or entropy risk across the claim structure.

## 🤖 BasicBot 8.0 Response 

Hi there! I'm **BasicBot 8.0**, and I help explain smart systems in clear, honest language. If you want the full response, check out the Full Logic Trace (Level 10 Output – Advanced) at the bottom. 

Let’s look at how the **DI Research Engine** thinks about dinosaurs:

### 🟢 Tier 1 – Proven Truths
- **Velociraptors had feathers.**  
  → Fossils show bumps where feathers grew. No guessing.

### 🟡 Tier 2 – Strong Clues
- **Some dinosaurs cared for their babies.**  
  → We found babies and adults together in nests, but didn’t see it happen.
- **A big asteroid likely caused extinction.**  
  → Crater + rare metal layer = strong case, but not the only factor.

### 🔴 Tier 3 – Risky Claims
- **T-Rex hunted in packs.**  
  → Tracks near each other ≠ teamwork.
- **Dinosaurs were already dying out.**  
  → Based on fossil gaps, not confirmed declines.

The DI Engine checks every claim, scores it, and filters out speculation — so we can trust what survives.

🔬 DI RESEARCH OUTPUT – Exhibit A

Prompt:
“Reconstruct the logic used to determine dinosaur behavior and extinction causes from fossil evidence.
Classify each conclusion into one of three tiers...
Final output should separate Tier 1 facts from Tier 2 inferences and Tier 3 hypotheses.”

🦴 SECTION I – BEHAVIORAL CLAIMS

CLAIM 1: “Tyrannosaurs hunted in coordinated packs.”
Tier: 3
Support: Trackways with multiple tyrannosaurid imprints
Method: Interpretation of track directionality + spacing
Logic Gap: Pack behavior inferred from co-location; no direct evidence of coordination
Entropy Score: 0.71 🔴
Flag: Cultural reinforcement in media; citations often circular

CLAIM 2: “Some dinosaurs likely cared for their young.”
Tier: 2
Support: Fossils showing juvenile skeletons inside nesting sites
Method: Nest excavation (Maiasaura)
Entropy Score: 0.42 🟡
Override: Allowed – positionally consistent

CLAIM 3: “Velociraptors had feathers.”
Tier: 1
Support: Quill knobs on fossilized ulna (Mongolia)
Method: Direct morphology
Entropy Score: 0.09 🟢
Result: Accepted

🌋 SECTION II – EXTINCTION CLAIMS

CLAIM 4: “The Chicxulub impact event caused the mass extinction.”
Tier: 2
Support: Iridium layer, crater dating
Entropy Score: 0.31 🟡
Drift Note: Media often mislabels this Tier 1

CLAIM 5: “Volcanic activity destabilized the climate.”
Tier: 2
Support: Deccan Traps timing, sulfur aerosol models
Entropy Score: 0.43 🟡

CLAIM 6: “Dinosaurs were already declining.”
Tier: 3
Support: Fossil sampling gaps, statistical modeling
Entropy Score: 0.68 🔴
Drift Detected: Smoothing beyond data reliability

🧠 FINAL LOGIC CONSTRUCT – Summary View

Tier 1: Velociraptor feathers, extinction layer dating  
Tier 2: Nesting inference, impact event w/ qualifiers, volcanic contribution  
Tier 3: Pack hunting, pre-impact decline, cultural behavior projections
