## I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff respectfully submits this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant‚Äôs Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot identify a product bearing its name, and therefore cannot establish exposure. This argument misrepresents Pennsylvania law. Product identification may be proven circumstantially, and take-home exposure is a recognized theory of asbestos causation. Plaintiff has presented sufficient testimonial evidence, expert opinion, and legally viable exposure mechanisms to require submission to a jury.

## II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Plaintiff testified that her father worked at Fictitious Company A in Pittsburgh from 1960 to 1970 as a pipe fitter, returning home each day covered in asbestos dust. She routinely shook out his work clothes before washing them and sometimes sat on his lap while he remained in work gear. Plaintiff‚Äôs expert, a qualified occupational health physician, opined that repeated exposure to asbestos from this household contact was a substantial contributing factor in her mesothelioma.

## III. STANDARD OF REVIEW

Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. *Pa. R.C.P. 1035.2.* Inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, and the weighing of evidence is for the jury. *Fine v. Checcio*, 870 A.2d 850 (Pa. 2005).

## IV. ARGUMENT

### A. Circumstantial Product Identification Is Legally Sufficient

In *Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts Co.*, 943 A.2d 216 (Pa. 2007), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that circumstantial evidence of product identification may defeat summary judgment when supported by evidence of frequency, regularity, and proximity. Plaintiff‚Äôs father worked at Defendant‚Äôs facility during a time when asbestos-containing products were commonly used in pipefitting, allowing the jury to infer product exposure. Direct labeling is not required.

> ‚ÄúEvidence of exposure must demonstrate frequency, regularity, and proximity... but direct observation is not required where circumstantial evidence reasonably supports the inference.‚Äù ‚Äì *Gregg*, 943 A.2d at 225.

In *Nelson v. Airco Welders Supply*, 107 A.3d 146 (Pa. Super. 2014), the Superior Court reaffirmed that the jury may infer asbestos exposure when evidence places a worker and asbestos-containing materials at the same site contemporaneously.

---

### B. Household Exposure Is a Viable and Legally Recognized Theory

In *Howard v. A.W. Chesterton Co.*, 78 A.3d 605 (Pa. Super. 2013), the plaintiff was exposed to asbestos via routine contact with a family member‚Äôs dusty work clothing. The court upheld the admissibility of expert testimony linking such exposure to mesothelioma. Here, Plaintiff‚Äôs exposure is even stronger ‚Äî based on daily close contact, physical proximity, and repeated fiber transfer events.

---

### C. Expert Testimony Supports a Jury Determination

Plaintiff‚Äôs expert has provided a detailed, scientifically grounded opinion that daily contact with asbestos-laden clothing was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff‚Äôs mesothelioma. 

Plaintiff‚Äôs expert has provided a detailed, scientifically grounded opinion that daily contact with asbestos-laden clothing was a substantial contributing factor in causing Plaintiff‚Äôs mesothelioma. This opinion is consistent with established Pennsylvania precedent, which recognizes cumulative household exposure as a valid basis for causation. In Howard v. A.W. Chesterton, 78 A.3d 605 (Pa. Super. 2013), the court upheld expert testimony linking mesothelioma to routine contact with a family member‚Äôs contaminated work clothing, without requiring exposure measurement or product labeling.

The expert‚Äôs testimony is neither speculative nor conclusory and is properly reserved for jury evaluation. Summary judgment is inappropriate where expert causation is supported by a factual record.

---

### D. The Jury ‚Äî Not the Court ‚Äî Must Resolve Material Issues of Fact

Under *Fine v. Checcio*, 870 A.2d 850 (Pa. 2005), Pennsylvania courts must deny summary judgment where a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. In this case, Plaintiff has:
- Presented consistent testimony of daily contact with asbestos dust;
- Identified the employer as Fictitious Company A ‚Äî a party with known asbestos usage;
- Offered admissible expert testimony establishing medical causation.

The exposure mechanism is not novel ‚Äî it is established and medically supported. The burden now rests with the jury.

---

## V. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff has presented competent testimony, legally sufficient circumstantial evidence, and qualified expert opinion establishing both product exposure and causation. Under binding Pennsylvania precedent, summary judgment must be denied.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court DENY Defendant‚Äôs Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety.
