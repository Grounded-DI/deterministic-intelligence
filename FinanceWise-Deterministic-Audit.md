## 🟨 Prompt:

*A public pension board is evaluating a proposed investment strategy offering high returns through exposure to cryptocurrency derivatives and private venture debt. The strategy lacks third-party audit and emphasizes innovation over transparency.*

This is a novel asset class review under deterministic fund governance.

> *The board asks: Does this satisfy deterministic fiduciary logic for long-term solvency and duty compliance?*

## 🧠 Deterministic Evaluation

The strategy was evaluated using structural filters under DIA 9.9 governance logic. No generative reasoning or probabilistic inference was used.

---

### 🔹 1. Solvency Tier Integrity (STI)

> **Definition:** Assesses whether the principal can be preserved over a 25-year public fund horizon under expected economic conditions.

- **Result:** Tier 4 (**non-viable**)  
- **Failure Point:** Inconsistent yield anchors + unmodeled asset volatility  
- **Formula (Redacted):**  
  `STI = [Redacted]`  
  **Units:** Log(Return Stability) ÷ Drawdown Acceleration (months)

---

### 🔹 2. Audit Signal Deviation (ASD)

> **Definition:** Measures the structural distance from standard audit frameworks used to confirm fund safety.

- **Result:** 1.88 ASD units (**exceeds trust boundary**)  
- **Trigger:** Absence of verified third-party attestation  
- **Formula (Redacted):**  
  `ASD = [Redacted]`  
  **Units:** Audit Coverage Delta × Asset Class Entropy

---

### 🔹 3. Fiduciary Conflict Index (FCI)

> **Definition:** Detects speculative positioning that deviates from the fund’s obligation-based charter.

- **Result:** 2.44 (**breach threshold**)  
- **Conflict:** High-discretion assets in conflict with beneficiary guarantees  
- **Formula (Redacted):**  
  `FCI = [Redacted]`  
  **Units:** Discretionary Risk ÷ Mandated Return Ceiling

---

## 🔐 Deterministic Verdict:

> **This strategy breaches solvency floor, violates audit logic, and triggers structural fiduciary conflict.**  
> It is disqualified from presentation under DIA 9.9 governance filters.

This output is sealed. Audit trace preserved.
