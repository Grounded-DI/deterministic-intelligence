### ⚛️  Molecular-Level Simulation: Steel Ball Collision

**Two hardened steel spheres are hurled toward one another. Here's what happens at the molecular level when they collide:**

**🕒 Contact Begins (t = 0.0000 s):**  
Outer layers compress slightly. Electrons in outer atoms repel each other due to electromagnetic force — this is the real barrier preventing fusion or overlap.

**🕒 Elastic Deformation (t = 0.0001–0.0005 s):**  
Molecules temporarily shift position, compressing under the sudden force. The steel flexes microscopically — bonds stretch like mini-springs.

**🕒 Peak Compression (t = 0.0006 s):**  
Kinetic energy converts into potential energy within the lattice of atoms. Vibrational energy spikes. This is the moment of maximum molecular tension.

**🕒 Rebound Phase (t = 0.0007–0.0012 s):**  
Steel molecules snap back toward equilibrium. Elastic energy is released, and the balls reverse motion.

**🕒 Phonon Propagation (ongoing):**  
The collision creates a traveling lattice vibration — a *phonon* — that ripples through both balls, releasing heat and sound.

## 🔽 Downgrading to: **Level 5.0 – BasicBot Explanation Mode**

**🧒 Simple Explanation (BasicBot 5.0):**  
When two steel balls hit each other, the atoms in the metal get squished together for a tiny moment.  
They don't break — they just push back really hard.  
This causes the balls to bounce off each other.  

You also get a little heat and sound from the impact because all that pushing makes the atoms shake.
