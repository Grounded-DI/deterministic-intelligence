Aspect: Depth vs Breadth  
- BandWise: Deep dive into harmony, rhythm, energy control  
- Company B: Broad survey across genre, lyrics, themes, legacy

Aspect: Key Concepts  
- BandWise: Non-functional harmony, entropy curves, timbre-emotion mapping  
- Company B: Genre-bending, textured layers, unique time signatures

- Company B: High-level adjectives, no musical scaffolding

Aspect: Emotional Mechanics  
- BandWise: Tracks emotion via energy entropy changes  
- Company B: Discusses themes (e.g., alienation) at surface level

Aspect: Tools & Terminology  
- BandWise: Theory (minor pentatonic, modulation, etc.), entropy models  
- Company B: Descriptive terms, journalistic metaphor
