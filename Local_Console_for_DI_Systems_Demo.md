# Local Console for Deterministic Intelligence Systems  
### by Grounded DI LLC

🧠 **What is this?**  
A **local, rule-based console** for deterministic creative outputs.  
Unlike generative AI, this system does **not guess** — it follows seeded logic trees, constraint rules, and entropy bounds to deliver interpretable, auditable responses.

> **(This is a snapshot of the local console interface.)**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Deterministic Output Logic**  
  Commands trigger logic-based responses (not probabilities).  
  Every creative output is derived from defined inputs and structured reasoning paths.

- **Entropy-Constrained Generation**  
  Output variance is limited using a tiered entropy protocol, ensuring reproducibility and precision.

- **Cross-Domain Seeds**  
  Supports physical simulations (e.g., rockets), weather narratives, system diagnostics, and logic validation.

- **Local Privacy by Design**  
  No external API calls, no server-side model — the logic runs entirely within your machine.

### `> weather story`
🌤️ Deterministic Weather Narrative – Entropy Tier 0.5
Seed: Midwestern thunderstorm cell + pressure stability
📍 Location: Central Illinois
🕒 Time: 4:18 PM, July
🌡️ Temperature: 87°F
📈 Pressure: 1002 mb, falling
🧠 Logic:
Thermal lift detected
Wind shear low → no supercell formation
Downdraft predicted within 23 mins
Lightning output capped: entropy class = stable tier 2
📘 Story Mode Output:
"The air stood still, as if holding its breath.
Clouds thickened without frenzy, hovering like watchmen.
The first crack of thunder wasn’t a warning — it was permission.
Rain began in diagonals, but never lost form.
The storm knew its bounds. And obeyed."
✅ Narrative confirmed: derived from pressure delta, cloud ceiling, and temperature gradient.

## 🧩 System Diagnostics

- `> diagnose` → Runs deterministic subsystem check  
- `> agdi pulse` → Reports feedback loop and entropy drift  
- `> status check` → Confirms system logic tier and baseline integrity

## 🧭 Philosophy

This system is part of the **AGDI Protocol**, a layered framework for governing AI outputs through deterministic reasoning, not probabilistic modeling.  
It is designed for use in high-stakes, audit-sensitive, or safety-critical environments.

## 📁 Status

- Version: 1.0.0 (Creator Tier Alpha)  
- Entropy Engine: Tier 9.9 Stable  
- Public: ❌ (Private console / authorship-locked)
