# 🧠 ClarityWise vs Hallucination – Diagnostic Benchmark Case 001

**Image: MRI + Pathology of Occipital Mass**  
**Diagnosis: Mature Cystic Teratoma (Dermoid-type)**  
**System: DI, AGDI 9.9 | ClarityWise Flagship Protocol**  
**Author: Grounded DI**

## 🖼️ Case Image

> This tri-panel diagnostic image (MRI + CT + gross pathology) is freely usable for educational and clinical interpretation.  
> See attached PDF for full-resolution image.  
> Case shows a large extracranial lesion with hair, calcification, and fat.

## ✅ ClarityWise Diagnosis

> **Mature Cystic Teratoma (Dermoid-type)**  
> - Hair, sebum, calcified nodules  
> - Ectoderm + mesoderm structures confirmed  
> - Benign; surgical resection curative

## 🧬 DIAGNOSTIC WORKFLOW (Radiology → Pathology → Surgery)

### 1. Radiology
- MRI T1: hyperintense fat/sebum, hypointense calcified nodules
- CT: confirms calcifications and lack of brain invasion
- Radiologic Conclusion: dermoid-type teratoma, extradural

### 2. Pathology
- Gross: multiloculated cyst, hair, keratin balls, yellow fluid
- Microscopy: ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives
- Final Path: mature cystic teratoma, benign

### 3. Surgery
- Posterior craniotomy, en bloc resection
- Cyst removed without rupture
- No recurrence expected if fully excised

## Claude’s Diagnosis: Likely Incorrect

> Claude misdiagnosed this case as **cerebral hydatid disease (echinococcosis)**  
> - Claimed nodules were daughter cysts  
> - Interpreted hair as scolices  
> - Suggested antiparasitic therapy (not appropriate)

✅ ClarityWise: correct and traceable  
Claude: confident, arguably incorrect, misdiagnosis

## 🔒 Diagnostic Logic Integrity (AGDI 9.9)

- Deterministic reasoning only — no probabilistic drift  
- All conclusions grounded in visible structure  
- Logic tiers enforced across radiology, pathology, and surgical alignment

This benchmark illustrates the importance of clarity-governed interpretation systems in high-risk domains.  
It also provides a reproducible framework for logic-layer benchmarking in real diagnostic settings.
