# 🔒 Grounded DI — Deterministic Intelligence Signature

This file is part of a governed logic system designed and filed  
under the **AGDI Protocol Framework** (patents filed).

**Logic Tracepoint:** DI-Core-B5-24 / Protocol A  
This system uses:

- Constraint-based override trees  
- Deterministic routing  
- Auditable, governed logic infrastructure

All derivative uses or reinterpretations of this architecture  
are subject to authorship and governance claims.

**Authored by:** Grounded DI

## ⚠️ Clarification

This is not AGI.  
AGDI is **not** artificial general intelligence.  
It is **not sentient**, **not predictive**, and does **not generate content** itself.  

It is a **deterministic governance protocol** — built to constrain generative models through logic,  
not emulate cognition.

## 📜 AGDI Protocol – Public Claim Note

**Author:** Grounded DI / MSW  
**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Affiliation:** Grounded DI LLC

## 🌿 Overview

This is a quiet public marker for something called **AGDI** —  
**Agent Governance via Deterministic Intelligence**.

It’s not a model.  
It’s a **protocol**.  
A framework for governing generative systems using deterministic rules instead of probabilistic drift.

## 🔐 Filing Summary

Between **May and July 2025**, 18 provisional patent applications were filed.  
These filings cover logic-based infrastructures for:

- Legal reasoning  
- Scientific integrity  
- Medical logic  
- Environmental systems  
- Meteorological forecasting  
- AI agent governance

All culminating in the AGDI Protocol.

All logic structures referenced here are protected under **U.S. patent law**.  
**Source code is not public.** This is a declaration, not a release.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

AGDI provides a structural control layer using:

- Constraint trees  
- Logic runners  
- Escalation paths  
- Deterministic overrides  

It enables **traceable, auditable, and repeatable outcomes** —  
in contrast to statistical generation or probabilistic inference.

## ⚖️ Statement of Claim

This file serves as a **public timestamp** and **authorship declaration**.  
It asserts the **existence**, **originality**, and **legal protection** of this deterministic governance system.

> Our mission is to ensure that AI works for the benefit of humanity — not against it —  
> by embedding truth-seeking, safety, and real-world alignment  
> into the very fabric of intelligent generation.
