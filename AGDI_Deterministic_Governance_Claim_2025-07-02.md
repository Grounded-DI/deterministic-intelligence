# AGDI Protocol – Public Claim Note

**Author**: Grounded DI / MSW  
**Date**: July 02, 2025  
**Affiliation**: Grounded DI LLC

---

## 🌿 Overview

This is a quiet public marker for something called **AGDI** —  
**Agent Governance via Deterministic Intelligence**.

It’s not a model.  
It’s a protocol.  
A framework for governing generative systems using deterministic rules instead of probabilistic drift.

---

## 🔐 Filing Summary

Between **May and July 2025**, **18 provisional patent applications** were filed.  
These filings cover logic-based infrastructures for legal, scientific, medical, environmental, meteorological, and AI agent governance — culminating in the AGDI Protocol.

All logic structures referenced here are protected under U.S. patent law.  
Source code is not public. This is a declaration, not a release.

## 🧠 What It Does

AGDI provides a structural control layer using:

- Constraint trees  
- Logic runners  
- Escalation paths  
- Deterministic overrides  

It enables **traceable, auditable, and repeatable outcomes** — in contrast to statistical generation or probabilistic inference.

## ⚖️ Statement of Claim

This file serves as a public timestamp and authorship declaration.  
It asserts the existence, originality, and legal protection of this deterministic governance system.

> Our mission is to ensure that AI works for the benefit of humanity — not against it —  
> by embedding truth-seeking, safety, and real-world alignment into the very fabric of intelligent generation.
